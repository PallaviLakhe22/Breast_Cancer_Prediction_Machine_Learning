# Breast_Cancer_Prediction_Machine_Learning

Problem Statement:
Given the details of cell nuclei taken from breast mass, predict whether or not a patient has breast cancer using the Ensembling Techniques. Perform necessary exploratory data analysis before building the model and evaluate the model based on performance metrics other than model accuracy.

Scope:
● Analysing the available data and exploring relationships among given variables
● Data Pre-processing
● Training SVM classifier to predict whether the patient has cancer or not
● Assess the correctness in classifying data with respect to efficiency and effectiveness of
the SVM classifier in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity and AUC ROC
● Tuning the hyperparameters of SVM Classifier provided by the scikit-learn library

Learning Outcome:
The students will get a better understanding of how the variables are linked to each other and build an SVM model. Apart from various performance measures, they will also learn about hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation to improve these scores.
